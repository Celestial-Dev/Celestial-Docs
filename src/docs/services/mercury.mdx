# Mercury (Public Alpha)
Mercury is a privacy focused service that you can download locally and run on any device with a browser. This keeps extensions like GoGuardian, Cisco Umbrella, and ContentKeeper from being able to peep on this site due to them not being able to access file and about:blank urls.
