# Markdown For Dummies
Markdown is a simple syntax that formats text as headers, lists, boldface, and so on. For people who want to contribute but don't know how to use markdown,
here's a simple guide on how to use it.

## React Markdown Name & Route
When making a new markdown react file (aka .mdx), you have to determine the name and route, to do that, place 3 dashes before and after the name and route, and have
the name above and route below, it should look something like this:
```
---
name: Example!
route: /example
---
```

## Headers
There are many types of headers, here's are the main ones explained briefly.

# Example
One # is the biggest header out of them all, and is usually for the title of the page!!

## Example
Two #s are the second biggest header, and usually used for subtitles. Here on the Celestial documentation site, they appear as smaller little routes below that you can
click on to go to specific parts of a document!!

### Example
Three #s are the second smallest header, and are used for displaying steps for settings something up or exploits!!

#### Example
Four #s are the smallest header, and are the same size as normal text except bolder!!

## Formating

```
Example
```
This terminal style box is made by putting 3 `s on above and below the text your text!!

`Example`

This terminal style font is made by putting 1 ` on each side of the text!!

These hotlinks are made by putting the word you want in brackets and right new to it (no spaces) the link you want in parenthesis!!
