## LTBEEF
(Patched on ChromeOS v106+)

Summary: LTBEEF is a permission escalation exploit that allows you to disable extensions enforced by your school admins. This can be useful if you want to be able
to use websites that are normally blocked by your school or want to keep your teachers from peeping on your activity throught proctoring software like Go Guardian.

### Step 1: Adding to Bookmarks Bar
Press Ctrl + D, click on More..., name the Bookmark whatever you like and where it says "URL" copy and paste this code into there:

```
javascript:prompt('Extension IDs here: (seperated by commas)').split(',').forEach(i=>{chrome.management.setEnabled(i.trim(),!1)})
```

### Step 2: Getting the ID of the extensions
To do this, open a new tab, go to chrome://extensions, click on the extension, and after where it says "?id", highlight and copy the long string of text. You can do
this for as many extensions as you want.

### Step 3: Running
Open a new tab, go to [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstorex) page and click on the bookmark you saved earlier, paste the IDs of the extensions you want to enter
and click "OK".

Boom, the extension(s) should be disabled now. If this doesn't work for you that means that you're either on ChromeOS v106+ or your school has blocked running
JavaScript code with bookmarklets.
